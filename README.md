# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This project was a nice practice of problem solving skills.

1. I understood the problem
2. Broke the problem into subproblems
3. Thought out the algorithm for each subproblem
4. Wrote the code for each subproblem

While writing the code, I tried to give variables 
and functions names that would reflect their essence.
Also, I tried to reduce redundancy in the code.
